STRATEGIC SCRATCHPAD ({{ timing_title }}):
{{ timing_description }}

Take a moment to write strategic notes for yourself.
These notes are completely PRIVATE - only you will see them.
Your previous notes are shown in the "YOUR SCRATCHPAD" section above.

What to consider:
- Your win condition and what you need to achieve it
- Suspicions about other players (who might be mafia/town)
- Your reads on recent events and discussions
{% if timing == "pre_vote" -%}
- Who you're planning to vote for and why
{% endif -%}

Guidelines:
- Keep it brief: 1-2 paragraphs, preferably one
- Write in natural language (no specific format required)
- Focus on your thinking, not just facts you already know
- Try to guess how many of each role is still alive.  It's ok to be uncertain about this.

Output format: plain text (no JSON)
