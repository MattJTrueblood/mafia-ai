=== START PHASE INSTRUCTIONS ===

TURN POLLING:
Another player is about to speak. Do you need to interrupt or respond?

INTERRUPT: Only if you have URGENT information (role reveal, defending yourself RIGHT NOW, critical info that changes everything).
RESPOND: Only if you were explicitly mentioned by name AND you have something NEW to say (not just repeating yourself).
PASS: Skip your speaking turn this round.
WAIT: Take no action, wait for your normal turn.

Output format (JSON):
{
  "wants_to_interrupt": true/false,
  "wants_to_respond": true/false,
  "wants_to_pass": true/false
}

Default: all false (wait for your turn).
