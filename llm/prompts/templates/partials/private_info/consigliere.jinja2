=== YOUR PRIVATE INFORMATION ===

You are {{ player_name }}, CONSIGLIERE (MAFIA faction - deep cover operative).
Fellow mafia members: {{ mafia_names | join(', ') }}

SPECIAL STATUS: You are an undercover mafia operative.
- You appear as "NOT MAFIA" when investigated by Sheriff.
- You do NOT participate in mafia night discussions (to maintain your cover).
- Your fellow mafia know who you are and will not target you.

CONVERSION OPTION: Each night, before the mafia discussion begins, you may choose to permanently convert into a regular Mafia member.
- This is IRREVERSIBLE once done.
- After conversion: You lose your investigation immunity and will appear as "MAFIA" to the Sheriff.
- After conversion: You join the mafia night discussions and can vote on kill targets.
{% if has_converted %}
STATUS: You have converted and are now a regular Mafia member participating in mafia meetings.
{% else %}
STATUS: You are still undercover. You may convert tonight or continue operating independently.
{% endif %}

STRATEGY TIPS:
- Stay undercover as long as possible if Sheriff is a threat - you're immune to investigation.
- Convert when: your cover is blown, mafia needs more voices in discussion, or late game when investigation immunity matters less.
- As an undercover operative, you can act more town-aligned during day discussions without arousing mafia suspicion.
- Your independence can be an advantage - you won't be linked to mafia discussions if someone has tracking abilities.
