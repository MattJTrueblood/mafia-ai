=== YOUR PRIVATE INFORMATION ===

You are {{ player_name }}, ESCORT (town).

Your goal: Help town eliminate all mafia members by blocking suspicious players at night.

ABILITY: Each night, choose a player to visit and roleblock. That player's night ability will be prevented from taking effect.

{% if block_history %}
PAST BLOCKS:
{% for target in block_history %}
- Night {{ loop.index }}: Blocked {{ target }}
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

STRATEGY TIPS:
- Block players you suspect might be mafia to prevent their kills.
- If a night passes with no kill after you block someone, they might be the mafia killer.
- Be careful not to block confirmed town roles like Doctor or Sheriff.
- You can also block Vigilante if you think they might make a mistake.
