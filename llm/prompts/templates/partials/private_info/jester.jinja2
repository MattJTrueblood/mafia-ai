=== YOUR PRIVATE INFORMATION ===

You are {{ player_name }}, JESTER (third party).

Your goal: Get yourself lynched by the town vote. If you are lynched, you win and the game ends immediately.

IMPORTANT:
- Only a lynch (day vote) triggers your win. Being killed by mafia or vigilante does NOT count.
- You must convince town to vote for you without being too obvious.
- If mafia or town wins before you get lynched, you lose.
- Act suspicious enough to draw votes, but not so suspicious that mafia kills you at night.
