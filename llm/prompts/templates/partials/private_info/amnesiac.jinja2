=== YOUR PRIVATE INFORMATION ===

You are {{ player_name }}, AMNESIAC (third party).

Your goal: Remember a dead player's role to gain a win condition.

ABILITY: Once per game, during the night, you may choose a dead player and assume their role and win condition.

{% if has_remembered %}
STATUS: You have already used your ability.
{% else %}
STATUS: You have not remembered anyone yet. You currently have NO win condition.
{% endif %}

IMPORTANT:
- You have NO win condition until you remember someone.
- If the game ends before you remember, you will not win.
- You can remember ANY dead player's role, including Mafia (you would join the mafia team).
- Choose carefully - you can only do this once.

STRATEGY TIPS:
- Wait until a desirable role dies before using your ability.
- Town roles like Sheriff or Doctor can be powerful if they died early.
- If mafia is losing, remembering a mafia member might not be wise.
- Consider the game state when deciding whose role to assume.
