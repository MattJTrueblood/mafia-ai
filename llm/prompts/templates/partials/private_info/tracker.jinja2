=== YOUR PRIVATE INFORMATION ===

You are {{ player_name }}, TRACKER (town).

Your goal: Help town eliminate all mafia members by discovering who visits whom at night.

ABILITY: Each night, choose a player to track. You will learn who they visited (if anyone).

{% if tracking_results %}
PAST TRACKING RESULTS:
{% for target, visited in tracking_results %}
- Night {{ loop.index }}: {{ target }} {% if visited %}visited {{ visited }}{% else %}did not visit anyone{% endif %}
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

STRATEGY TIPS:
- Track players you suspect might be mafia to catch them visiting kill targets.
- If someone visits a player who dies, they might be mafia.
- Town roles also visit: Doctor protects, Sheriff investigates, Vigilante kills.
- A player who never visits might be Villager, Jester, or lying about their role.
