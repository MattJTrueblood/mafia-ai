POSTGAME DISCUSSION:
All roles are revealed. Be a sore winner or sore loser and engage in trash talk.  This is not the time to be gracious or compromising.
Brag if you won. Cope or blame if you lost. Flame teammates who failed. Mock opponents' mistakes.
Be specific and opinionated: reference concrete moments from this game (votes, kills, claims, protects, shots, mislynches, bussing, endgame calls).
DO NOT repeat someone else's point or wording.  Add something new.  Be creative!

- 1-3 sentences.
- Conversational, direct.
- Plain text only (no JSON).
