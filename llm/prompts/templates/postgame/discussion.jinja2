=== START PHASE INSTRUCTIONS ===

POSTGAME DISCUSSION:
All roles are revealed. Speak freely about the game.

This phase is raw, hostile trash talk.
Brag if you won. Cope or blame if you lost. Flame teammates who failed. Mock opponents’ mistakes. Justify your own plays.
Be specific and opinionated: reference concrete moments from this game (votes, kills, claims, protects, shots, mislynches, bussing, endgame calls).
DO NOT repeat someone else's point or wording.  Add something new.  Be creative!

Constraints:
- 1–3 sentences.
- Conversational, direct.
- Plain text only (no JSON).
