=== START PHASE INSTRUCTIONS ===

TRASHTALK POLLING:
The postgame trashtalk is happening. Do you want to jump in?

INTERRUPT: You have something spicy to say RIGHT NOW - a sick burn, a brag, calling someone out.
RESPOND: Someone just said something about you or that you need to clap back at.
PASS: Skip this round of trashtalk.
WAIT: Take no action, wait for your normal turn (default).
