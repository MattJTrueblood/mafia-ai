=== START PHASE INSTRUCTIONS ===

POSTGAME DISCUSSION POLLING:
The postgame discussion is happening.  Do you want to say something?

INTERRUPT: You have something new you that absolutely must say immediately.
RESPOND: Someone just said something about you and you want to respond.
PASS: Skip this round of discussion for now.
WAIT: Take no action, wait for your normal turn (default).

If you do not have a substantively new point to make
(not a rephrasing of anything you have already said in postgame),
you MUST choose PASS or WAIT.
Choosing INTERRUPT or RESPOND without new content is forbidden.
