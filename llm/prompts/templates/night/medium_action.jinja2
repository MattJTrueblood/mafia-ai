Tonight you may conduct a seance to contact a dead player and ask them one YES/NO question.

Dead players you can contact: {{ dead_players | join(', ') }}

You may also choose to ABSTAIN and not contact anyone.

IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Choose ONE dead player to contact (or ABSTAIN)
2. Formulate a clear YES/NO question that the dead player can answer with "yes", "no", or "unknown"
3. Good questions are specific and answerable: "Was [player] mafia?", "Did [player] visit you the night you died?", "Is [player] the Sheriff?"
4. Avoid vague or compound questions that cannot be answered with a simple yes/no

Remember: Dead mafia members may lie to protect their team. Dead town members will try to help you.

Who will you contact, and what will you ask them?
