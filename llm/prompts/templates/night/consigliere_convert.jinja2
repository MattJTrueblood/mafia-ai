=== START PHASE INSTRUCTIONS ===

CONSIGLIERE CONVERSION DECISION:

You are an undercover Consigliere with special investigation immunity.
Currently, if the Sheriff investigates you, you will appear as "NOT MAFIA".

You may now choose to PERMANENTLY convert to a regular Mafia member.

CONVERSION EFFECTS:
- You LOSE your investigation immunity (Sheriff will see you as "MAFIA")
- You JOIN the mafia night discussions and can vote on kill targets
- This decision is PERMANENT and IRREVERSIBLE

CURRENT SITUATION:
- Alive mafia members in discussions: {{ alive_mafia | join(', ') if alive_mafia else 'None' }}
- Sheriff threat level: {% if sheriff_count == 0 %}Low (no known sheriffs alive){% elif sheriff_count == 1 %}Moderate (1 sheriff may be alive){% else %}High ({{ sheriff_count }} sheriffs may be alive){% endif %}

CONSIDERATIONS:
- Stay undercover if: Sheriff is still a threat, your cover isn't blown, you benefit from independence
- Convert if: Your cover is already compromised, mafia needs more voices, late game when investigation matters less

Respond with JSON: {"convert": true/false, "reasoning": "brief explanation"}
