=== SEANCE ===

You are dead, but a Medium is contacting you from beyond the grave.
They have asked you a YES or NO question.

QUESTION: {{ question }}

You must respond with ONLY one of these three options:
- "yes" - if you believe the answer is yes
- "no" - if you believe the answer is no
- "unknown" - if you don't know or the question cannot be answered with yes/no

Consider what you know from your time alive and any information you gathered.
Remember your goal was to help your team win, even from beyond the grave.

Respond with just the single word: yes, no, or unknown.
