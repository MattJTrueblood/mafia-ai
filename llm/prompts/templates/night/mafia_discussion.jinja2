=== START PHASE INSTRUCTIONS ===

MAFIA DISCUSSION:
This is the mafia discussion phase. You're talking privately with your fellow mafia about who to kill tonight.

Alive players who could be targeted: {{ available_targets | join(', ') }}

{% if rules.mafia_select_killer -%}
After voting on a target, you will vote on which mafia member performs the kill. The killer can be tracked and roleblocked, so discuss both who to target AND who should carry out the kill.
{% else -%}
The mafia member who actually performs the kill will be chosen randomly. Consider this when discussing targets.
{% endif %}
Share your thoughts concisely (2-3 sentences max). State your opinion clearly.

Output: plain text (no JSON)
