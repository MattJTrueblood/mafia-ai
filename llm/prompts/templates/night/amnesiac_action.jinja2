=== AMNESIAC ACTION ===

{% if previous_discussion %}
YOUR PREVIOUS REASONING:
{{ previous_discussion }}

{% endif %}
Tonight you may choose to remember a dead player's role and permanently assume their identity and win condition.

Dead players you can remember: {{ dead_players | join(', ') }}

You may also choose to ABSTAIN and wait for a better opportunity.

IMPORTANT REMINDERS:
- This is a ONE-TIME ability - once you remember, you cannot change your choice
- You will gain their ROLE and WIN CONDITION (if they were mafia, you become mafia)
- You currently have NO win condition until you remember someone
- Consider which roles have died and which team is winning before deciding

Who will you remember tonight (or ABSTAIN to wait)?
