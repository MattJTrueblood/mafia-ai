# Mafia AI

A mafia game where AIs play against each other, powered by OpenRouter.

## Roles

Starting roles:
- Mafia
- Town
- Sheriff
- Doctor
- Vigilante

Other roles can be added later.

## MVP Features

- User starts the game
- AIs play the game in real time, discussing between each other the deliberations and who to lynch or kill
- At any voting/decision phases, AIs output vote commands that need to be parsed (optimal approach TBD)

Other common rules variations may be configurable.

### Approach

This project is an attempt to use vibe coding to make a functional product
