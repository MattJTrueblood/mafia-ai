# Roadmap (in order):

## Roadmap: global rule variation

- **Rule variation categories**

  - **Information / flip rules**
    - Full flip (alignment + role)
    - Alignment-only flip
    - No flips
    - Flip on all deaths
    - Filp on lynch only

  - **Vote rules**
    - Absolute majority vs plurality lynch
    - No-abstain allowed
    - Secret ballots

  - **Investigation rules**
    - Alignment result only
    - Full result (alignment + role)

  - **Starting role count visibility**
    - Full reveal (exact role counts)
    - Alignment/category only
    - No role list revealed

## UI second pass

UI right now is not ideal.  not everything is visible on the same screen.  Exceptions/errors aren't visible except in logs.
Discussion Status window is pretty broken.  Game events can be cleaned up a little and some redundant stuff can be removed.

## Better gambits

Encourage the AIs to do interesting or weird plays.  I have lots of ideas for this but none are very good yet.

## Personalities

Rather than just rely on the default model personalities I want to give the AIs some character.  The challenge is not just telling the AIs to roleplay or pretend to be silly at the expense of good gameplay, but rather to embody the character and play to their strengths.
An easy way might be to give them strategy cards like "You should be aggressive..." or "You should be cautious" or "You should try to be a leader".

## UI third pass

instead of a simple webpage with a game event log and such, make a UI like a visual novel.  Stretch goal

## I want to play too

at the minimum I want to be able to send messages from god down into the game events that the players can all see.  At the maximum I want to have my own player which I can speak as and type as in the game like one of the AI agents.
